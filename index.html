  <h1>Bias in Metacritic Video Game Ratings</h1>
    <button id="nextButton">Next</button>
    <p>Metacritic is a website that aggregates and averages video game ratings from a multitude of sources. In this visualization, we will be exploring whether Metacritic scores present any obvious biases based on price, genre, or size of playerbase. First, we will explore the correlation between rating and price via the graphs below. From these graphs, it can be observed that average Metacritic score appears to vary slightly with price, with the most expensive games having a higher average rating. At the same time, it should be noted that the range of scores at each price point remains high regardless of the price.</p>
